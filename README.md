## ü§î How to use

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Introduction 

BUM is an NFT Auction Platform. The goal of the platform is to make selling NFT's accessible to a wider audience. In the platform, users have profiles that show their collection of NFT's which they've purchased. Users can also place bids in Ethereum on the NFT's. You can also discover popular and trending auctions on the Home and on the Explore page. It is a single-page web app built with React, Next.js, JavaScript, and HTML & SASS.


## üòè Some tips

- Use the colors from the `src/styles/colors.scss` file
- Use the custom `Link` component provided in the example
- Define pages in separate folders
- Use the classNames module when adding multiple (or single) classes
- Define components in the `/components` folder
- You shouldn't delete files from the boilerplate. You can only delete the Example component or build on top of it.

## üí° The idea

The project uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js), which is a framework for server-rendered React apps.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
If you prefer, you can [use styled-components instead](https://mui.com/guides/interoperability/#styled-components).

## The link component

Next.js has [a custom Link component](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).
The example folder provides adapters for usage with MUI.
More information [in the documentation](https://mui.com/guides/routing/#next-js).
